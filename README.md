# QR_Code_Scanner
Android Barcode And QR Code Scanner (Scanning via Intent)
It is the most easiest way of creating a Barcode And Qr Scanner in android using Android Studio. Using the app- https://github.com/zxing/zxing .

In this app, we'll use the ZXing (Zebra Crossing) library to carry out barcode scanning within an Android app. We'll call on the resources in this open source library within our app, retrieving and processing the returned results.

Since we're using the ZXing library, we don't need to worry about users without the barcode scanner installed, because the integration classes provided will take care of this for us. By importing the ZXing integration classes into our app, we can make user scans easier and focus our development efforts on handling the scan results.
